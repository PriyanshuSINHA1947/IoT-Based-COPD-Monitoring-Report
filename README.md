# IoT-Based-COPD-Monitoring-Report
This project presents a remote health monitoring solution for patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). It utilizes IoT technologies to continuously measure and monitor critical vital signs — specifically oxygen saturation (SpO₂) and heart rate  data via I2C using MRAA on embedded Linux.
